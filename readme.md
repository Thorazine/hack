```


## Asset and database deployment
Run (although you might want to look at your migration folder first)
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=hack --force
php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run dev
```


## Database
The default setting for strictness of the database is set to ```true```. This needs to be ```false``` for the system to work since we 
use the eloquent ```groupBy```.


## Filesystem
This package uses the default Laravel Filesystem to handle storage. For settings take a look at the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/filesystem).
Personally I like to start of with the ```public``` driver setting and the ```php artisan storage:link``` command. To do so add ```FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=public``` to the ```.env``` file.
Obviously you are going to want to have the url availible on whatever driver you use.


## Cache
We use tags to control the cache. So set ```.env``` ```CACHE_DRIVER``` to ```array```, memcached or redis. ```file``` will not do.
To set the cache time for the pages you can add ```PAGE_CACHE_TIME=[minutes]```. The default has been set to 1 minute cache.
But you can set it to whatever you want.


## Important
Make sure you have a mail driver setup. If you don't have that option just use ```log``` although I recommend [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog). But be sure to make it functional on the production server as we send out mails to confirm the location when needed.

Make sure your ```.env``` file is in order, especially the ```APP_URL``` which is used by the filesystem locally.

Also, to properly work with locations we use the Google api. You are going to want to get a key at [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key). Once you have an api key add ```GOOGLE_KEY=[key]``` to your ```.env``` file.

Now visit http://[domain]/cms and fill in the blancs.


## Example website
To get started you can seed the database with a simple Hack website. The seeder can be run by executing
```
php artisan db:seed --class=Thorazine\\Hack\\Database\\Seeds\\HackExampleSite
```
