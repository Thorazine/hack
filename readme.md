# Add to config/app.providers:

        'Form' => Collective\Html\FormFacade::class,
        'Html' => Collective\Html\HtmlFacade::class,
        'Debugbar' => Barryvdh\Debugbar\Facade::class,
        'Image' => Intervention\Image\Facades\Image::class,
        'Activation' => Cartalyst\Sentinel\Laravel\Facades\Activation::class,
        'Reminder' => Cartalyst\Sentinel\Laravel\Facades\Reminder::class,
        'Sentinel' => Cartalyst\Sentinel\Laravel\Facades\Sentinel::class,

        'Location' => Noprotocol\LaravelLocation\Facades\LocationFacade::class,

# Add to the App\Http\Kernel $routeMiddleware:

        'sentinel.auth' => \Thorazine\Hack\Http\Middleware\SentinelAuthentication::class,
        'site' => \Thorazine\Hack\Http\Middleware\SiteRedirect::class,

# Add to resources\lang\en\validation.php
```php
    'slug'                 => 'Not a valid slug (a-z, 0-9, \'_\', and \'-\' are allowed',
```


Run
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=hack --force
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=location
php artisan migrate
npm install
gulp
```

Create a folder in ```public``` and call it ```uploads```. This is a temporary upload folder to assist with the streaming of images to any storage.

# Filesystem
This package uses the default Laravel Filesystem to handle storage. For settings take a look at the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/filesystem).
Personally I like to start of with the ```public``` driver setting and the ```php artisan storage:link``` command. 
Obviously you are going to want to have the url availible on whatever driver you use.

# Important
We use tags to control the cache. So set .env CACHE_DRIVER to array, memcached or redis. File will not do.

Make sure you have a mail driver setup. If you don't have that option just use "log" although I recommend [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog). But be sure to make it functional on the production server as we send out mails to confirm the location if needed.

Make sure your .env file is in order, especially the APP_URL. This is used by the filesystem.

Now visit http://[domain]/cms and fill in the blancs.
