## Installing Hack
Take a Laravel project with a working database.

Run
```
composer require thorazine/hack
```


## Add to config/app.providers:

```php
Thorazine\Hack\HackServiceProvider::class,
```

## Run installation
Run:
```
php artisan hack:install --force
npm install
npm run dev
```

This command runs some commands and finds and replaces some settings. What it exactly does can be found on the 
(wiki page)[https://github.com/Thorazine/hack/wiki/Manual-installation-and-setup].


## Settings
Now that all basic settings have been done you will need to fill in the blancs in your ```.env``` file.
A Google API key can be retrieved (here)[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key].


## Testing
To see if everything has gone as planned you can run the (installation test)[https://github.com/Thorazine/hack/wiki/testing]. 


## Setup your site
Visit http://[domain]/cms and fill in the blancs.


## Example website
To get started you can seed the database with a simple Hack website. The seeder can be run by executing
```
php artisan db:seed --class=Thorazine\\Hack\\Database\\Seeds\\HackExampleSite
```
